# Movies-Correlation-Project
This project aims to explore correlations between various movie attributes, such as budget, gross revenue, ratings, and scores, to uncover patterns and insights.
The analysis is performed on a movie dataset containing columns like name, rating, genre, year, score, votes, director, writer, star, country, budget, gross, company, and runtime.

Key Steps:
-Data Loading: Import the movie dataset into Python using pandas.
-Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and ensure all necessary columns are in the correct format (e.g., numeric).
-Correlation Calculation: Calculate correlations between numerical variables such as budget, gross, rating, and runtime to identify any significant relationships.
-Data Visualization: Use seaborn and matplotlib to create heatmaps and scatter plots that visualize correlations and trends.

Tools and Libraries:
-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualization of correlations and trends.
-Numpy: For numerical operations.
