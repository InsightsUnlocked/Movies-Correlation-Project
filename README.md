![movie_industry]([https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/2745/4541/1e920aef8d13d86d2c6f4b1aa78561d1/dataset-cover.jpg](https://github.com/InsightsUnlocked/Movies-Correlation-Project/blob/main/movie_industry.jpg))
This project aims to explore correlations between various movie attributes, such as budget, gross revenue, ratings, and scores, to uncover patterns and insights.
The analysis is performed on a movie dataset containing columns like name, rating, genre, year, score, votes, director, writer, star, country, budget, gross, company, and runtime.

Key Steps:
- Data Loading: Import the movie dataset into Python using pandas.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and ensure all necessary columns are in the correct format (e.g., numeric).
- Correlation Calculation: Calculate correlations between numerical variables such as budget, gross, rating, and runtime to identify any significant relationships.
- Data Visualization: Use seaborn and matplotlib to create heatmaps and scatter plots that visualize correlations and trends.

Tools and Libraries:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualization of correlations and trends.
- Numpy: For numerical operations.
